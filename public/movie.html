<h3>The Wolf of Wall street</h3>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNGCav9fRhc"><img src="../assets/images/wolf.jpg" alt="The wolf of wall street at a glance" draggable="true"/></a>
<p>This is THE BEST movie to ever exist.It is abashed and shameless, exciting and exhausting, disgusting and illuminating; it's one of the most entertaining films ever made about loathsome men..</p>
<h3>The Social Network</h3>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww17x5RTFdQ"><img src="../assets/images/social2.jpg" alt="Social network at a glance" draggable="true" /></a>
<p>"You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enimies".THE SOCIAL NETWORK is not about Facebook. It's about Mark Zuckerberg and the people associated with him and the consequences that arise with the evolution of Facebook.I've rewatched it more than anything</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdJKm16Co6M&ab_channel=20thCenturyStudios"><img src="../assets/images/fightclub.jpg" alt="Fight club at a glance" draggable="true" /></a>
<p>Fight Club is NOT about fighting! Or consumerism or any of that.Fight club uses fighting as the perfect metaphor for doing painful things that are out of your comfort zone.</p>
